# Sugarcane Production Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes sugarcane production data from various countries around the world. It explores factors such as production quantity, acreage, yield, and production per person, and provides insights into sugarcane production trends and patterns.

## Data Source

The data used in this analysis was obtained from [source of the dataset, e.g., a website or a CSV file]. It includes information on sugarcane production for different countries, including:

- Country
- Continent
- Production (Tons)
- Production per Person (Kg)
- Acreage (Hectare)
- Yield (Kg / Hectare)

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The following steps were performed to clean and preprocess the data:

1. Removing unnecessary columns: The "Unnamed: 0" column was dropped.
2. Renaming columns: Columns were renamed for better readability and consistency.
3. Handling missing values: Rows with missing values were removed.
4. Data type conversion: Columns were converted to appropriate data types (e.g., float).

## Analysis and Visualizations

The analysis focuses on understanding sugarcane production patterns and trends using descriptive statistics, univariate analysis, and bivariate analysis. Various visualizations, including bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps, were created to illustrate the findings.

**Key Insights:**

- Brazil, India, and China are the top sugarcane producers, accounting for a significant portion of global production.
- There is a positive correlation between acreage and production, indicating that countries with larger sugarcane cultivation areas tend to have higher production.
- Guatemala has the highest yield per hectare.
- Paraguay has the highest production per person.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into sugarcane production across different countries and continents. The findings can be used to understand production patterns, identify high-performing countries, and explore opportunities for improvement in sugarcane cultivation.

## Usage

To run this analysis:

1. Download the dataset and save it as "List of Countries by Sugarcane Production.csv".
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in Google Colab.
3. Execute the code cells in order.
4. Explore the visualizations and insights presented in the notebook.
